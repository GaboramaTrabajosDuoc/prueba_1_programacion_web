                On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
                and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                 foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
                 in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These 
                 cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and 
                 when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. 
                 But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
                 pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle 
                 of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
